- **High score on Lighthouse audition:** achieved by using the 'Static Generation' from Next.js and small bundle size(using webpack 5, and only include necessary libraries).

- **With code quality in mind:** auto lint codes with **Eslint**, **Prettier**, **Stylelint** before commit, use **Code Climate** to get automated code review comments.
